- Swarm intelligence? Agents each w/ differennt purposes
- Think of debbuging whenn creating vizualization
- Fully-connected network foor each input
	- "Areas of the brain"
	- Better than auxiliary networks?
- How to allow "junk DNA"? (Instead of allowing errors)
- Create more neurons in saturated areas
- Reproduce b/w species?
- Softmax is always used
- Ability too create new input?
	- Like creating new organns
	- Ideally we want to evolve towards that (new input)
- Encoder = Genotype | Decoder = Phenotype
- String-matching genes is also more efficient
- Weight-mutation? Based on gaussian if so
- When to add a  new layer?
	- If adding new noe, fully connected
	- When to change structure and when to change weights
- "Cap value" to avoid overfitting (?)
